# I-Am-Rich-2023
First app from my (re)Boot Camp (2023 reboot of the Udemy iOS App Development course). 

On this reboot of my iOS Dev journey, I'm going to be using Xcode to both show my work as well as to summarize my learning through each unit/project. 

This was the first app, which just introduced us to Xcode. (We didn't even use .swift files at all, just the main.storyboard file.)

Things we learned: 
* Creating a new Xcode project, team, and bundle identifier
* Xcode basics (layout, pertinent tabs, etc.)
* Adding and editing Storyboard elements using editor tabs/inspectors (background color, label, and image view)
* Customized design elements (colors, fonts, etc.) using the storyboard editors (specific 
* Running apps on both the Xcode simulator and sideloading (including wirelessly) to an iOS device
* Adding and managing .xcassets files
* Creating and importing app icons (in various sizes for various size ratios... obsolete in 2023?)

Additional resources used: 
* Canva.com: created the app icon (love those layered gradients! :) in the original 1024x1024px size [https://www.canva.com]
* App Icon Generator: created different size ratios of image files from the original icon image file [https://www.appicon.co/#image-sets]
* ColorHunt: searched curated color palettes for hex codes for a desired color [https://colorhunt.co]
* Various other original London App Brewery course resources, such as troubleshooting sideloading flowchart, Xcode map, etc.
